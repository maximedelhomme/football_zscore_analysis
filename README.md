# Football Player Scouting â€“ Football Manager

A personal project designed to build a position-based scoring model for football players, using data extracted from Football Manager.

Goal: Create a role-specific performance evaluation system inspired by professional scouting logic, allowing objective comparisons across players based on tailored KPIs.

## Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Feature engineering (possession adjustment, league level, playtime normalization)
- Scoring model (Z-scores, weighted sub-scores, percentiles)
- Visualization: Power BI

## Outcome
- Role-based standardized score (out of 100)
- Interactive dashboard with filters (position, age, footedness, league...)
